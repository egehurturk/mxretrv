input: domain list
output: list of DNS MX records for each domain


! multithreaded --> seperate thread for each domain

Examples:
    mxretrv google.com -f domainlists.txt -o mxdocuments.csv
    mxretrv google.com yahoo.com ...

CL Format:
    mxretrv v0.1 - SNAPSHOT
    Usage:
        mxretrv -f|--file input_file -o|--output output_file [-b|--batch-size size] [-m|--multi] [-v|--verbose]

    Options:

        domain_names: list of domain names delimited with ' ' (read from stdin ('\n') if no domain_names is passed)

        -f --file: a text file containing domain names delimited with "\n"

        -o --output: CSV file to output MX records for each domain name (otherwise stdout is used)

        -b --batch-size: the number of domain names to process in each thread (if multithreading is not enabled, the value of this argument will be ignored)

        -m --multi: enable multithreading

        -v --verbose: output extra information about the process

        -h --help: print this message

Design Thoughts:
    We'll have a JAR file --> compiled source code
    make this executable:
        shell script?
            (/usr/local/bin may cause problems (may have to copy the entire project dir???))

    [Worker #1] --> takes in a batch of input (Runnable) and outputs:
    {

        "Domain_Name_2": ["MX_1"], ["MX_2"], ..., ["MX_N"],

        pool executes Worker W

    ω = number of threads (constant) (163)
    β = ⌊N / ω⌋           (batch size)
    α = N - βω            (remaining size)
    δ = ⌈ α / β ⌉         (remaining thread)
    N > ω is guaranteed


    Prove that δ = 1

    δ =  ⌈ α / β ⌉ = ⌈ (N - βω) / ⌊N / ω⌋ ⌉
                   = ⌈ (N - ⌊N / ω⌋ω) / ⌊N / ω⌋ ⌉



    =======================================================================================


    Given the input file (a text (txt) file containing domain names delimited with
    '\n') and the input size, the program splits the work into "batches" (if
    multithreading is enabled and input size is larger than the limit). The program
    generates a fixed thread pool with size 200, as maximum thread number is
    163 + remaining threads (which is always 1), and spawns a thread responsible for
    doing its work for its batch.

    Every thread should get the MX document for batch_size domains. The goal is to store
    the MX documents in an output file. But if every thread simultaneously tries
    to access and write to output file, race condition occurs.

    One way to overcome this problem is to have a single thread that handles I/O job,
    that is, writing to output file, and have other threads simply put the text to be written
    to a queue that the I/O thread draws from.

    One other way is to lock (make it synchronous) the threads when they print their results
    to the output file.
