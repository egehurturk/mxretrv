============

Command-Line Arguments:
-----------------------
-m --multi: enable multithreading (otherwise the execution will run on single thread)

-i --input: input file (with "\n" separated domains)

-o --output: output file (should be JSON)

-b --batch-size: number of domains each thread processes (keeping it low increases thread number)

-v --verbose: verbose mode


How it works:
-------------
Every thread gets ```batch_size``` number of domains. Thus keeping batch_size low increases the thread number, leading to a faster execution.
A green checkmark at the end of output indicates that the list is complete
